ABSTRACT
<pic> spools_in_cabinet
“Slow fashion” encompasses a burgeoning social movement, grassroots clothing industry, and thriving community that collectively endeavors to answer this question. By weaving together everyday practices, alternative models for fashion production, and an online community, slow fashion practitioners aim to unstitch the global systems of fast fashion. Using a multi-sited, multimodal ethnographic method–which knits together a creative blend of digital and traditional ethnographic methods and a personal making practice–my dissertation explores how slow fashion practitioners endeavor to answer the question: can we transform how clothes are made, bought, and sold? 

To do this, I conducted 18 months of ethnographic research with slow fashion practitioners geographically situated in the Pacific Northwest, and another digitally constituted on Instagram as they strive to undo the environmental harms and exploitations which drive the contemporary fashion industry. Specifically, my research addresses the following questions: (1) How might relations—to community, labor, and consumption—be reconfigured through feminist-inspired care-based practices?; (2) What ethical tensions and political possibilities are produced when an online community of women uses digital platforms to resist commodification? and (3) what moral ambiguities and non-capitalist possibilities are embedded in the efforts to alter the structures of fashion production through the slow fashion industry?

Methodology
Using a creative blend of digital and traditional ethnographic methods and a personal making practice I conducted 18 months of digital and traditional ethnographic research, ending in December 2022. The multi-modal methodology I employed in my research examines slow fashion from three strands: (1) personal practice, (2) online (3) in the industry. Each of these strands correlates with my research questions. After creating a public-facing Instagram page (@jimil.goes.slow) in 2021, I used my platform to recruit 75 slow fashion practitioners: from across a network of field sites (Burrell 2009) in Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, and on Instagram over 18 months. My research practice incorporated digital methods (Boellstorff 2008; Hine 2000; Postill and Pink 2012), especially Bluteau’s (2021) method of ‘immersive cohabitation,’ and traditional ethnographic methods including participant observation and narrative analysis (Rosaldo 1980).

<SEWING>
SEWING AS ETHNOGRAPHIC METHOD
My ethnographic practice involved making a fully handmade wardrobe based on the stories, concepts, and experiences I encountered in the field. This wardrobe will include seasonally functional garments (such as outwear), everyday clothing, and one special occasion garment, all intended to replace ready-to-wear clothing consumption. 

Home sewing is a common activity for slow fashion community members and I use my practice to explore the material and technical dimensions of slow fashion, this includes learning about fiber content, garment construction and fit, and the many layers of labor involved in clothing production.  As I made this wardrobe, I also shared it using my Instagram. This process is an ongoing way to connect my interlocutors. I position my sewing and Instagram practices as a creative and praxis-oriented form of participant observation. 

Each garment in my portfolio holds significance to the project and is an entry point into the research questions I am asking. Like field notes, these garments are a material archive that I can come back to (and wear) over and over as I begin to weave together my dissertation.
